# advent-of-code

I started doing advent of code in 2022. I didn't complete all the challenges, as I had some more important commitments later in the month. All of my solutions to the 2023 AoC will be posted 1 January 2024.

I do not complete these challenges competitively; I complete them simply because I enjoy puzzles, and as exercises to further my knowledge in the languages I use to solve them.
